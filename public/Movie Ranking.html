 <h1>The Best Movies that I Recommend</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies All The Time</h2>
 <hr />

 <h3>Avatar: The Way of Water</h3>
 <p>This is my Favorite movies all the time. The Way of Water looks fantastic. It’s a technical marvel, showcasing what 13 years, endless amounts of money, and no care about the human cost of overtime crunch can accomplish. It’s a reminder that good 3D can look amazing and immersive.</p>
 
 <h3>Star Treck Beyond</h3>
 <p>A fun popcorn movie that highlights the value of teamwork and a good playlist (priceless core values in life).</p>
 
 <h3>Captain America: The First Avenger</h3>
 <p>To see Captain America in a WWII backdrop battling Red Skull on the big screen is every fanboy’s dream, and Johnston delivers the goods.</p>
